# 📊 AI Product Review Analytics System

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project builds an end-to-end analytics pipeline to analyze product reviews and generate actionable insights using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

The system integrates **FastAPI (backend)**, **Streamlit (frontend)**, and **Machine Learning (NLP & Clustering)** to transform raw customer feedback into meaningful business insights.

---

## 🎯 Business Objective

To analyze customer reviews and automatically:

- Classify sentiment (Positive, Negative, Neutral)
- Identify recurring product issues
- Generate product improvement strategies
- Provide interactive visualization for better decision-making
